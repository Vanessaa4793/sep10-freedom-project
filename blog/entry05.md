## Context
For this Blog we are still currently working on our tool, mine is Aframe. In the end we are going to make a website based on our tool. So far I been watching youtube videos and using the intro into Aframe to tinker with my IDE. I learned that you can use Aframe to make things 3D and use your creativity to explore your interests. For my website I am trying to make a 3D basketball court so basically in my IDE I am going to use Aframe code to make it. For example I used this code and changed it around a little bit in IDE to make it somewaht like a basketball court...
