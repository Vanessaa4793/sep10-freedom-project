## Context
For this Blog we are still currently working on our tool, mine is Aframe. In the end we are going to make a website based on our tool. So far I been watching youtube videos and using the intro into Aframe to tinker with my IDE. I learned that you can use Aframe to make things 3D and use your creativity to explore your interests. For my website I am trying to make a 3D basketball court so basically in my IDE I am going to use Aframe code to make it. For example I used this code and changed it around a little bit in IDE to make it somewaht like a basketball court...
```<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/1.5.0/aframe.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <a-scene>
      <a-box position="-1 0.5 -3" rotation="0 45 0" color="#4CC3D9"></a-box>
      <a-sphere position="0 1.25 -5" radius="1.25" color="#EF2D5E"></a-sphere>
      <a-cylinder position="1 0.75 -3" radius="0.5" height="1.5" color="#FFC65D"></a-cylinder>
      <a-plane position="0 0 -4" rotation="-90 0 0" width="4" height="4" color="#7BC8A4"></a-plane>
      <a-sky color="#ECECEC"></a-sky>
    </a-scene>
  </body>
</html>
```
It didn't work so I had to find other codes so I continued to watch youtube videos. For my website to make it look good I will be using Bootstrap.

## Sources
I used Youtube to find more information on Aframe. Which showed me different people using aframe to make their ideas come to life making it virtual.
These are some of the links I used..
