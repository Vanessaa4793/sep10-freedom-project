### Context
For this part of the blog, I have been researching to learn more about basketball. To know about what kind of hardwares/softwares they use to improve basketball everyday.

### Engineering Process/Skills
Over the course of the past couple weeks, I have been in the research process of the engineering design process. 
One of the skills I used was `how to learn` which helped me to know the hardwares that are used to make basketball better. The next I used was `how to google`, one of the things I searched up was "What kind of hardwares are used in Basketball" [Elite Basketball](https://midwestelitebasketball.com/articles/hardware-vs-software/). Another interesting article I saw was [nbas futuristic plan](https://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/behind-nbas-futuristic-plans-replace-person-fans-virtual-technology-orlando-restart/2270101)
