### Context
For this part of the blog, I have been researching to learn more about basketball. To know about what kind of hardwares/softwares they use to improve basketball everyday. 

### Technology Process
Continuing my process as a Sep student, I am currently on the second step which is research. I am finding out more about how basketball is improving everyday. They way I am going to achieve this by using the skills:

* How to Google

* How to learn

* How to read

### Skills
Over the course of the past couple weeks, I have been in the research process of the engineering design process. 

One of the skills I used was:

`How to learn` which helped me to know how to play basketball better. Allowed me to learn from my misakes to not hurt myself in the future. Watching NBA games and clips of basketball players fixing thier mistakes and the amount of work they do each day to make themselves better.

The next I used was:

`How to google`, one of the things I searched up was "What kind of hardwares are used in Basketball" [Elite Basketball](https://midwestelitebasketball.com/articles/hardware-vs-software/).This article taught me more about the types of hardware/ software is being used in basketball to make it what is it today. Basketball is still advancing even now to make basketball more enjoyable to watch and creating ways to make more money than they are making now. Another interesting article I saw was [nbas futuristic plan](https://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/behind-nbas-futuristic-plans-replace-person-fans-virtual-technology-orlando-restart/2270101)


### Research on the types of hardwares

Hawk-eye Technology-used to help referees quickly review officiating decisions 

Optical tracking Technology- its able to capture the player and ball movements real-time in three dimensions

Technology in basketball is important because it increases fan engagement, share of time and focus

Technology has improved the NBA by allowing replays, wireless communication, and also used to keep track of players information

In the past, basketball used shot clocks and three point lines but now they use instant replay and analytics

Wearable technology- manages players heart rate, tracks breathing, and pulse patterns

Sensors- able to understand and push playerâ€™s boundaries of what they are trying to achieve, improves their game decision-making, and optimizes training

AI technology- automatically generates individualized highlight packages for each player in every match.
