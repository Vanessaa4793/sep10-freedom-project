### Aframe Context
For this blog entry, we are working on finding a tool. I chose the tool Aframe because I would like to use it for my Freedom project which is based off of Basketball. Aframe is based off of HTML which would be easy when I use my IDE. Also Aframe would be fun to work with because I would like to create a virtual basketball court that is 3D. Aframe is a virtual reality program where you can create 3D figures and WebXR scenes. 


### Tinkering
I tinkered with Aframe by using my IDE. And also I went on the Aframe website and looked at documentation that helped me with my tinkering. For my tinkering I tried changing exisiting code like a cylinder and a plane and by the image shown below the plane is the flat gray surface with the blue cylinder inside of it.
```
<a-cylinder color="crimson" height="3" radius="1.5"></a-cylinder>
<a-plane color="#CCC" height="20" width="20"></a-plane>
```
