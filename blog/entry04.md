### Aframe Context
For this blog entry, we are working on finding a tool. I chose the tool Aframe because I would like to use it for my Freedom project which is based off of Basketball. Aframe is based off of HTML which would be easy when I use my IDE. Also Aframe would be fun to work with because I would like to create a virtual basketball court that is 3D. Aframe is a virtual reality program where you can create 3D figures and WebXR scenes. 


### Tinkering
I tinkered with Aframe by using my IDE. And also I went on the Aframe website to find code that helped me with my tinkering.
