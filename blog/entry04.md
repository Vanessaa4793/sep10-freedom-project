### Aframe Context
For this blog entry, we are working on finding a tool. I chose the tool Aframe because I would like to use it for my Freedom project which is based off of Basketball. Aframe is based off of HTML which would be easy when I use my IDE. Also Aframe would be fun to work with because I would like to create a virtual basketball court that is 3D. Aframe is a virtual reality program where you can create 3D figures and WebXR scenes. 


### Tinkering
I tinkered with Aframe by using my IDE. And also I went on the Aframe website to find code that helped me with my tinkering.
```
<a-cylinder color="crimson" height="3" radius="1.5"></a-cylinder>

<!-- Hexagon. -->
<a-cylinder color="cyan" segments-radial="6"></a-cylinder>

<!-- Pac-man. -->
<a-cylinder color="pink" theta-start="50" theta-length="280" side="double"></a-cylinder>

<!-- Green pipe. -->
<a-cylinder color="orange" open-ended="true"></a-cylinder>
