# Entry 7
##### 5/31/24

## Context

For this blog, I have finished my website, in-class presentation, and Expo elevator pitch. For both my in-class presentation and expo elevator pitch I have recieved some feedback to make me better. Coming towards the end of the year, I have learn many things leading up to make my website being able to use Bootstrap, Html, CSS, most importantly A-Frame. 

## Website feedback

Kostela- Grow- In my opinion you should change the width of the image in the carousel when it's on mobile view because it doesnâ€™t show the whole image.
Glow-I really like how the carousel changes the images.

Keith- Grow- If you want to try to make the part a Information into a card and make that card next to the basketball then lead them to the images below.
Glow- Having clickable words that sends you to an image or website

Nayer- Grow: I would make the bottom pics a little smaller. As well as the basketball card could be better if it was center.
Glow- I really love the way the navbar looks and back-drops.

After seeing this feedback I tried to do it on my own to make my wesbite but I turned out unsuccessful and didn't have time to seek a peer tutor.

## In- class presentation

The feedback that I have recieved from Mr. Mueller is:

I had a nice hook and good explanations of my wesbite and slides. A grow that he had for me is being aware of walls of text- that less is more. 

Presentation Grade: 8.5/10

## Takeaways from Elevator Pitch

1. Adding more in my Part A- the Hardwares and Softwares

2. Being more Confident in my presentation when presenting to others

3. Being more Creative
