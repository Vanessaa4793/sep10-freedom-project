### Content
I chose the topic of technology because anything that involves working with the computer interests me. The thought of making new websites and letting people see it and giving me feedback intrigues me. There is a gaming company called Roblox, and I used to play it a lot when I was younger, I was always used to think how did they get so many games into one app as I grew older I knew it had something to do with code and it sparked my interest into becoming a computer enigneer. Even though I don't know everything there is to coding I am still willing to try even when it gets hard because it is my passion and I want to persue it as a job. Some articles that I use to do my research are...

### Technology process
As a beginneer, I am currently in the first step of my learning process, which is to get better at code and learn more diffcult codes. The way I am going to achieve this step is to 
1. Use google
2. Ask my peers or Mr. Mueller
3. Sign up for coding websites like girls who code that can help me better myself
4. Practice by making websites

### Skills 
Some skills that I have learned is how to google, using my resources that are around me and communication.

### How to google
Since I am interested in Technology more in the computer engineering range, I searched up thst in google. I skimmed through the results and picked out the articles/details that were the most interesting. I came across this articles called "What is Computer Engineering Technology?" https://www.softwareengineerinsider.com/careers/computer-engineering-technology.html, this article deepen my knowledge of computer engineering and its salary. Doing further research, I looked up computer engineering coding and found the article called "Computer Science vs. Computer Engineering" https://www.coursera.org/articles/computer-science-vs-computer-engineering and this website even allows you to search things up.
