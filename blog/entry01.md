### Content
I chose the tooic of basketball because even though its a sport there are many technology advancements behind it.

### Technology process
As a beginneer, I am currently in the first step of my learning process, which is to get better at code and learn more diffcult codes. The way I am going to achieve this step is to 
1. Use google
2. Ask my peers or Mr. Mueller
3. Sign up for coding websites like girls who code that can help me better myself
4. Practice by making websites

### Skills 
Some skills that I have learned is how to google, using my resources that are around me and Time management.

### How to google
Since I am interested in Technology more in the computer engineering range, I searched up thst in google. I skimmed through the results and picked out the articles/details that were the most interesting. I came across this articles called "What is Computer Engineering Technology?" https://www.softwareengineerinsider.com/careers/computer-engineering-technology.html, this article deepen my knowledge of computer engineering and its salary. Doing further research, I looked up computer engineering coding and found the article called "Computer Science vs. Computer Engineering" https://www.coursera.org/articles/computer-science-vs-computer-engineering and this website even allows you to search things up.

### Time Management
This was a very hard skill to develop but I have gotten better at it even on off days. I have to juggle between sports and schoolwork, sometimes I get home very late and still manage to complete my work. If I am free during school, I would complete some of my assignments to make it easier on me when I get home. As I ger older though, I know my work is going to be alot more so I have got to manage myself better. Often times I would use a timer and set a set for myself for each homework assignment so I can keep myself on track and it worked out for me so far.

### Summary
To sum this all up, I am excited to see what the future holds for me and coding, and to see if I would persue coding when I grow up.
